This project is a fork of 2 different projects, although I don't know how to do that because this is the first time I've used github.
Credit to https://github.com/bahjat-kawar/time-diffusion @bahjat-kawar for coming up with an incredible new idea for a diffusion.
Please check out his page for a description of how it works. I believe he only scratched the surface of what it is capable of doing.

I believe with this Diffusor, Images can be generated vasty different than anything the model has ever seen, I don't know if I will ever finish it, because I have no 
idea what I am doing... but hopefully others will join the cause.

Credit also to guaneec for laying the groundwork for this to be implemented in Automatic1111, I will do my best to try and make it work.
